============

This is a simulation of multi-robot environment for CS599 Coordinated mobile robotics class. The environment is a canvas without any sort of obstacle (static/dynamic). All the robots have full communication. They are connected to one and another and also with a host computer(centralized algorithm). The user writes a message or draws a picture in the GUI which is translated to the ground(painting) or sky(sky-writing). The main crux of this simulation is the coordination between these robots in both decentralized and centralized way, each having its own pros and cons.
